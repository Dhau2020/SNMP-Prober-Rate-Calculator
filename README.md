# SNMP-Prober-Rate-Calculator
This project contains a Python script to probe an SNMP agent, calculate rate of change for OIDs, and handle types like COUNTER32, COUNTER64, GAUGE, and OCTET_STR. It manages counter wraps, agent restarts, and ensures sampling frequency. Outputs include UNIX timestamp and OID rates, with OCTET_STR printed directly.
